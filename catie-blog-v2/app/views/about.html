    <p>My name is Catie.  I live in the Mountain West, with my husband Ben, in a tiny 750 sq. ft. apartment.  I looove making things.  I knit, sew, crochet, glue things, paint things, refinish things. Poor Ben.  There is rarely a moment in our apartment that I am not creating a mess somewhere.  But he does reap the benefits when it comes to my cooking and baking.</p>

    <p>Currently, Ben is in school and I stay at home.  When we aren't busy being AWESOME, we can be found eating ice cream:</p>
